I am writing this letter to apply as a Data Engineer Intern at Indicina. I am confident that my experience, knowledge and qualities makes me a better candidate for the role. 

I graduated at LASUSTECH formerly Lagos State Polytechnic. At the time, i was already working as a technical support personnel and Data Processing Teacher in Wonderful Lord College.
Over the years, I was learning yet i was teaching and i realized the more i teach i get to know better. This great experience has taught me how to become better and quickly pick up any IT Skill.

I took a Data Analytics Course organized by LinkedIn and Microsoft also a Data Engineering Course on DATACAMP where i learned how to interact with relational databases to query, input, and modify data and get hands-on experience in importing and cleaning data in Python, optimizing your code for efficiency, and writing tests to validate your code.

Also I have the foundational skills will allow you to work with data in various ways such as how to interpret data visualizations, create functions, and utilize version control. 

I would love to be a part of Indicina Family, So I am readily available to take up this internship opportunity as it would help me contribute to the organization and also improve my skills.

You can reach me on 08173708011 or email samuelhardy58@gmail.com

Thank you for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

USE GIT PUSH DEVELOP WHEN YOU WANT TO PUSH TO THE CODE.
I used 
git branch to know my branch
git checkout develop 
git pull 
when u get message telling you to commit changes or stash. commit will keep changes before u pull while stash will delete changes made on your own computer before u pull.
i used git stash 
- it switches to develop if such branch exists. if not it creates it. however if it was created on another developer's end./incomplete
to check ur branch, type git branch

USE GIT PUSH -U ORIGIN DEVELOP(BRANCHNAME)
